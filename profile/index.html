            <p>
              Nice to meet you. I'm a UI/UX Designer and a Product Designer
              based in San Francisco. I have one more semester left at the
              Academy of Art University in San Francisco, majoring in
              Interaction and UI/UX Design. At the same time, currently, I'm a
              UX Designer at the Samsung Research America-Mobile Platform
              Solutions team. I started the journey as a UX Design Intern at
              Samsung 6 months ago, and I am now a Junior UX Designer at the
              same company working with the same team. I try to involve as many
              people as possible since collaboration and setting up the same
              vision and goal with the team is truly important. I love watching
              users develop an affinity for services, allowing for services,
              allowing services to become part of the very fabric of people's
              lives.
